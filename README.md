# Yavanna
* Small project to discover a bit Rust and GTK+ *

## State

It's the first functional iteration I made, so it's ugly as hell. I planned to improve it while I learn to decipher GTK documentation.

## Origin of the name

"The Sleep of Yavanna refers to the period in Middle-earth's history between the Spring of Arda and the rising of Moon and Sun, during which almost all living things slept and Middle-earth was lit only by starlight." [Source](lotr.fandom.com) 

## Purpose 

I was tired to fall asleep watching Netflix and never cut my portable, so here is a little timer that shutdown the system after a given time or at a specified hour. 

## How to run it

There is a pre-compiled version in the bin folder (compiled on Fedora 29), just do `./yavanna`.

Or you can use Cargo with `cargo run` to compile and run it or you can just compile it with `cargo build`.

## Requirements 

You need to have on your system in order to run it:
* `GTK+` (which is usually installed on Linux distros)

If you want to compile it :
* `Rust` and `Cargo`
